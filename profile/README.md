# The DogeNet Project

This is the official page for The Netdoge Project.
For now we are developing an efficient, secure and fast peer-to-peer communication system.
We have no future plans for other projects for now, but we'll come up with something.

## The Projects:

### Dogenet

The easy to implement, header only communication system with various optional methods of cryptography.
It also has a Lua interface for simplifying editing messages in real time.

### Netdoge

A simple terminal based implementation of Dogenet.
